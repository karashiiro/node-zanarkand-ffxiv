# Contributing Guidelines
- If you edit MachinaWrapperJSON, don't worry about anything, Actions will handle it for you bb
- If you're fixing bugs or correcting field names here, don't worry about that either.
- If you're adding support for a packet or adding a new feature here, put `feat:` before your commit message so the middle version number gets bumped.
